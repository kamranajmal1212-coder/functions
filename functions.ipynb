        "1 What is the difference between a function and a method in Python?\n",
        "->In Python, a function is an independent block of code defined using def or lambda that performs\n",
        "  a specific task and can be called directly by its name. A method, on the other hand,\n",
        "  is a function that is defined inside a class and is associated with an object. Because of this,\n",
        "  a method is always called using the object it belongs to, such as object.method().\n",
        "  While functions stand on their own, methods operate on the data stored within an object and often use that object’s attribute\n",
        "\n",
        "2 Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.\n",
        "->In Python, parameters are the variable names listed in a function’s definition,\n",
        " while arguments are the actual values passed to the function when it is called.\n",
        " Parameters act as placeholders that receive the values supplied during the call.\n",
        " For example, in def add(a, b):, the variables a and b are parameters.\n",
        " When the function is executed using add(5, 3), the numbers 5 and 3 are\n",
        " the arguments assigned to those parameters. This system allows functions\n",
        " to accept input values, process them, and produce outputs, making them flexible and reusable.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?\n",
        "->In Python, a function can be defined in two main ways: using the traditional def keyword,\n",
        " which allows you to create a named function with a block of code, and using a lambda function,\n",
        " which creates a small anonymous function in a single line. Once defined, a function is called\n",
        " by writing its name followed by parentheses, optionally passing arguments inside them (for example, add(5, 3)).\n",
        " Methods inside classes are also functions but are called through objects, such as obj.method().\n",
        " Functions can also be called using keyword arguments, positional arguments, default arguments,\n",
        " or unpacking using *args and **kwargs, giving Python a flexible and powerful way to define and invoke functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the purpose of the `return` statement in a Python function?\n",
        "->The return statement in a Python function is used to send a value back to the\n",
        "part of the program where the function was called. It ends the function’s execution\n",
        "and provides the final output of that function. Without a return statement, a function\n",
        "automatically returns None, meaning it doesn’t give back any usable value. By using return,\n",
        "you can produce results, pass data to other parts of the program, and make your functions\n",
        "reusable and meaningful.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n",
        "->In Python, an iterable is any object that can be looped over, such as lists,\n",
        "tuples, strings, sets, or dictionaries. An iterable contains multiple elements\n",
        "and provides an iterator when passed to the iter() function. An iterator, on the\n",
        "other hand, is an object that allows you to retrieve elements one at a time using\n",
        "the next() function. It keeps track of the current position in the sequence so it\n",
        "knows which item to return next.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n",
        "->In Python, generators are special functions that allow you to produce a sequence\n",
        "of values one at a time, instead of generating and storing all values in memory at\n",
        "once. They use the yield keyword instead of return. Each time a generator yields a\n",
        "value, it pauses its execution and remembers its internal state. When the generator\n",
        "is called again, it resumes from where it left off rather than starting from the beginning.\n",
        "Generators are defined just like normal functions using the def keyword, but they contain\n",
        "one or more yield statements.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
        "->Generators offer several advantages over regular functions, especially when\n",
        "dealing with large amounts of data. The biggest benefit is memory efficiency—generators\n",
        "produce values one at a time instead of creating and storing an entire list in memory,\n",
        "which makes them ideal for large sequences or streams of data. They also support lazy\n",
        "evaluation, meaning values are generated only when needed, which improves performance\n",
        "and reduces unnecessary computations. Additionally, generators allow functions to pause\n",
        "and resume their execution using yield, making them useful for tasks like reading large\n",
        "files, handling infinite sequences, or managing pipelines of data. Overall, generators\n",
        "help create cleaner, faster, and more efficient programs compared to regular functions\n",
        "that return full lists or data structures at once.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n",
        "->A lambda function in Python is a small, anonymous function defined using the lambda\n",
        "keyword instead of def. It can take any number of arguments but can contain only a\n",
        "single expression, whose result is automatically returned. Because lambda functions\n",
        "are concise and do not require a name, they are typically used for short, simple\n",
        "operations that are needed only once—such as in map(), filter(), sorted(), or as\n",
        "quick callback functions. For example, lambda x: x * 2 is a lambda function that\n",
        "doubles its input. Lambdas help keep code shorter and cleaner when writing small,\n",
        "temporary functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Explain the purpose and usage of the `map()` function in Python\n",
        "->The map() function in Python is used to apply a specific function to each item\n",
        "in an iterable (such as a list, tuple, or set) and return a new map object containing\n",
        "the transformed results. It allows you to process or modify multiple elements without\n",
        "writing an explicit loop. The general form is map(function, iterable). For example,\n",
        "map(lambda x: x * 2, [1, 2, 3]) applies the lambda function to every element and\n",
        "produces values 2, 4, 6. You can convert the result to a list using list(map_object)\n",
        "if needed. Overall, map() makes your code cleaner and more efficient by applying a\n",
        "function to an entire collection in a single step.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()` functions in Python.\n",
        "->In Python, map(), reduce(), and filter() are functional programming tools, but each serves\n",
        "a different purpose. map() applies a function to every element in an iterable and returns a\n",
        "new iterable of transformed values—for example, doubling all numbers in a list. filter()\n",
        "selects elements from an iterable based on a condition and returns only those that satisfy\n",
        "the given test, such as keeping only even numbers. reduce(), which is available in the\n",
        "functools module, repeatedly applies a function to pairs of elements in an iterable to\n",
        "reduce the entire sequence into a single cumulative value—for example, summing all numbers\n",
        "in a list. In short, map() transforms, filter() selects, and reduce() combines elements\n",
        "into one final result.\n",

        "11. Using pen & Paper write the internal mechanism for sum operation using  reduce function on this given\n",
